<p>Interactive systems are widely used in research and clinical practice, yet most scientific venues make it impossible to fully communicate exactly how they work.  IMIC combines live demos, hands-on examples, and scientific publications to support exchange of ideas among a community of like-minded researchers.  IMIC seeks to showcase and disseminate the best examples of dynamic interaction with medical imagery.</p>

<p>Examples of appropriate topics for IMIC:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visualization of large multiparametric, multimodal, and/or multisubject imaging data</li>
<li>Interactive control of image segmentation or registration algorithms</li>
<li>Software architectures to optimize the use of high-performance computing (e.g. clusters or GPUs)</li>
<li>Novel interaction or visualization devices such as native 3D displays, head-coupled tracking, hand tracking, gesture detection, custom user input devices and related technologies</li>
<li>Interactive simulations of body systems, disease processes, and interventions</li>
<li>Education and training systems that use interactive methods</li>
<li>Other research that involves interactive computing applied to medical image computing</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="submission-process" class="anchor" href="#submission-process"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Submission Process</h3>

<p>We will be using an automated submission management system.  The conference management URL will be posted before submission the deadline.</p>

<p>Submissions will be carefully peer-reviewed by a selected group of researchers with extensive experience in IMIC.
Workshop presentations are expected to represent a cross section of the best available research in this area.
As this is an emerging field that has not been historically well-covered in the MICCAI literature,
accepted submissions will set a precedent that can be expected to be widely discussed.</p>

<p>Materials from the workshop will be collated and made available via the <a href="http://InteractiveMedical.org">InteractiveMedical.org</a> web site as a record of the event and a resource to the field.</p>

<h6>Paper format</h6>
<p>Papers should be formatted using the 
<a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0" title="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0" rel="nofollow"><font color="#0066cc">LNCS style files</font></a> 
and can have up to 8-10 pages, but shorter papers accompanied by videos or live demonstrations 
will also be given full consideration.<br /></p>

<h6>Parallel Submissions</h6>
<p>Submitted work has to be 
original, not identically submitted in parallel to other conferences or 
workshops. We accept papers that provide further detail on algorithms also 
validated in the MICCAI challenge workshops. We ask authors to reference
 the challenge contribution explicitly.<br /></p>

<h6>Review process</h6>
<p>The review of the papers will be double-blind to the extent physically possible. 
Submissions should be anonymous according to the MICCAI guidelines.<br /></p>

<h6>Previous MICCAI submissions</h6>
<p>If desired authors can upload the MICCAI reviews and rebuttal to be considered by the workshop chairs.<br /></p>

<h6>Patent disclosure policy</h6>
<p>The purpose of the workshop is to exchange ideas and methods to advance the state of medical care. Attendees 
of the workshop and readers of the proceedings are expected to be able to implement and use the presented methods
in their own work. 
<em>Any restrictions on the usability of presented methods,
whether for commercial or for non-commercial applications, must be disclosed.</em>
<br /><br />
This information should be included in a separate section at the end of text in the final ('camera-ready') 
version of the manuscript, and it will be printed in the proceedings in order to help your readers to 
make informed decisions.</p>

<a name="why-imic" class="anchor" href="#why-imic"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why IMIC?</h3>

<p>The Medical Image Computing literature traditionally favors fully-automated analysis algorithms that offer the potential high throughput, objective, and reproducible results for large data collections.  However fully-automated techniques are not able to handle many time-critical tasks, nor can they handle tasks that require contextual or general knowledge not readily available in the images alone.  This workshop addresses the topic of human interaction with algorithms for initialization, steering, quality control, and visualization for problem domains such as segmentation and registration, object detection, tracking.  The workshop format encourages hands-on demonstrations to stimulate interaction between developers and the user community of clinicians, neuroscientists, and biologists.  Attendees are encouraged to bring challenging real-world datasets and allow active experimentation with various tools on different data.  In the call for participation in the workshop we ask for extended abstracts or short papers that are accompanied by live demos.  Our focus will be on original methods and elegant implementations that establish a human-machine dialog.  Evaluation will be based on productivity, accuracy, simplicity, and overall user experience.</p>
